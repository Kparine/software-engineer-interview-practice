# Smiley or parens

You have a cooworker that is very precise with their parentheses, for every open parens, there is a close parens, but they have a bad habit of interspersing smiley faces :) in their messages.

Figure out if a message is correctly formatted

Example 1:
'()' -> true

Example 2:
'(:))' -> true

Example 4:
'((:))' -> false
